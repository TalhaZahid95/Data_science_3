"WAYMAR ROYCE","What d’you expect? They’re savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they’re ripping each other to pieces.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"WILL","I’ve never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I’ve never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"WAYMAR ROYCE","How close did you get?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"WILL","Close as any man would.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"GARED","We should head back to the wall.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROYCE","Do the dead frighten you?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"GARED","Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won’t trouble us no more.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROYCE","You don’t think he’ll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"WILL","Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even k*ll the children.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROYCE","It’s a good thing we’re not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter … If I don’t catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won’t say it again.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROYCE","Your dead men seem to have moved camp.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"WILL","They were here.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"GARED","See where they went.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROYCE","What is it?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"GARED","It’s …","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","Go on. Father’s watching.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","And your mother.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"SEPTA MORDANE (to SANSA)","Fine work, as always. Well done.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"SANSA","Thank you.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"SEPTA MORDANE","I love the detail that you’ve managed to get in this corners. … Quite beautiful … the stitching …","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","Don’t think too much, Bran.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBB","Relax your bow arm.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON/ROBB","Quick, Bran, faster!","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CASSEL","Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They’ve captured a deserter from the Night’s Watch.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Get the lads to saddle their horses.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","Do you have to?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","He swore an oath, Cat.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CASSEL","The law is law, my lady.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Tell Bran he’s coming, too.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","He won’t be a boy forever. And winter is coming.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBB","Lad, go run back and get the rest.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"WILL (muttering)","White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"WILL","I know I broke my oath. And I know I’m a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I’m no coward. Tell them I’m sorry.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"WILL (whispering)","Forgive me, lord.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name …","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON (to BRAN)","Don’t look away.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","King of the Andals and the First Men …","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","Father will know if you do.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","You did well.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","You understand why I did it?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BRAN","Jon said he was a deserter.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","But do you understand why I had to k*ll him?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BRAN","Our way is the old way?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BRAN","Is it true he saw the White Walkers?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BRAN","So he was lying?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","A madman sees what he sees.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","What is it?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"THEON","Mountain lion?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","There are no mountain lions in these woods.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"THEON","It’s a freak.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","It’s a direwolf.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Tough old beast.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBB","There are no direwolves south of the Wall.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","Now there are five.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","You want to hold it?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BRAN","Where will they go? Their mother’s dead.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CASSEL","They don’t belong down here.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Better a quick death. They won’t last without their mother.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"THEON","Right. Give it here.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BRAN","NO!","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBB (disgustedly to THEON)","Put away your blade.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"THEON","I take orders from your father, not you.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BRAN","Please, father!","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","I’m sorry, Bran.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BRAN (to JON)","What about you?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","I’m not a Stark. Get on.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBB","What is it?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"THEON","The runt of the litter. That one’s yours, Snow.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","As your brother, I feel it’s my duty to warn you  You worry too much. It’s starting to show.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI","And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We’re Lannisters. Lannisters don’t act like fools.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI","What if Jon Arryn told someone?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","But who would he tell?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI","My husband.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he’s off f*cking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI","You should be the Hand of the king.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","That’s an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","You have five northern children. You’re not an outsider.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","I wonder if the old gods agree.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","It’s your gods with all the rules.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","I am so sorry, my love.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Tell me.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Your sister. The boy …","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","He’s coming this far North, there’s only one thing he’s after.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","You can always say no, Ned.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion’s chamber. I’m told he reads all night.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"MAESTER LUWIN","I’m told he drinks all night.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","How much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"LUWIN","We’ve brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we’ll find out.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","In any case, candles.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","Why’s your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"THEON","It’s for the queen, I bet. I hear she’s [sleek as a mink?]","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBB","I hear the prince is a right royal prick.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"THEON","Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBB","Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He’s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BRAN","I saw the king! He’s got hundreds of people!","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","How many times have I told you  No climbing!","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BRAN","But he’s coming right now! Down our road!","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","I want you to promise me  No more climbing.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BRAN (looking down)","I promise.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","D’you know what?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BRAN","What?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","Where’s Arya? Sansa, where’s your sister?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA’s helm]","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ARYA (pushing BRAN)","Move!","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Your Grace.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","You’ve got fat.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","Cat!","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","Your Grace.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","Nine years. Why haven’t I seen you? Where the hell have you been?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ARYA","Where’s the Imp?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"SANSA","Will you shut up?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","Who have we here? You must be Robb. (To Sansa) My, you’re a pretty one. (To Arya) Your name is?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ARYA","Arya.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ARYA","That’s Jaime Lannister. The queen’s twin brother.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"SANSA","Would you please shut up.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","My queen.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","My queen.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI","We’ve been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","Ned.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ARYA","Where’s the Imp?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI","Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Tell me about Jon Arryn.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","We both did.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and f*ck girls. He showed me what was what.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Aye.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","Don’t look at me like that. Not his fault I didn’t listen. (They laugh. ROBERT sighs.) I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you’re no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","I’m not worthy of the honor.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","I’m not trying to honor you. I’m trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it’s not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We’ll join our Houses.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROS","Did you hear the king’s in Winterfell?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","I did hear something about that.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROS","And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","And the other brother?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROS","The queen has two brothers?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","There’s the pretty one. And there’s the clever one.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROS","I hear they call him the Imp.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","I hear he hates that nickname.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROS","Oh? I hear he’s more than earned it. I hear he’s a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","Clever girl.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROS","We’ve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","Have you?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","The gods gave me one blessing.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","Don’t get up.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROS","M’lord.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","You’ve much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","She has odd cravings, our sister.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don’t leave me alone with these people.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","I’m sorry, I’ve g*n the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","I thought you might say that. But since we’re short on time, (he opens the door; a bevy of whores enter and descend on TYRION) Come on, girls. See you at sundown.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","Close the door!","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","She was my sister. This is where she belongs.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","She belonged with me.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","In my dreams, I k*ll him every night.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","It’s done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","Not all of them.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS (off camera)","Daenerys!","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS","Daenerys! There’s our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn’t he a gracious host?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"DAENERYS","We’ve been his guests for over a year and he’s never asked us for anything.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS","Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won’t forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. (He pulls off her gown.) You have a woman’s body now. (She endures it as he strokes her breast.) I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"DAENERYS","No.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS","When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"MAID","It’s too hot, my lady.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS","Where is he?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ILLYRIO","The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ILLYRIO","(Greets them in Dothraki.) May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ILLYRIO","Come forward, my dear.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS","Where’s he going?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ILLYRIO","The ceremony is over.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS","But he didn’t say anything. Did he like her?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ILLYRIO","Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn’t like her, we’d know.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ILLYRIO","It won’t be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father’s throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS","When will they be married?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ILLYRIO","Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS","Is it true they lie with their horses?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ILLYRIO","I wouldn’t ask Khal Drogo.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS","Do you take me for a fool?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ILLYRIO","I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I’ve given offense.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS","I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS","So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"DAENERYS","I don’t know.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS","We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo’s army. I would let his whole tribe f*ck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that’s what it took.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"SANSA","Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I’m ugly?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"SANSA","He’s so handsome.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"SANSA","When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","Hush now. Your father hasn’t even said yes.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"SANSA","Why would he say no? He’d be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","He’d have to leave home. He’d have to leave me. And so would you.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"SANSA","You left your home to come here. And I’d be queen someday. Please make father say yes.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","Sansa…","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"SANSA","Please, please. It’s the only thing I ever wanted.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BENJEN","Is he dead yet?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","Uncle Benjen!","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BENJEN","You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn’t want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren’t you at the feast?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BENJEN","Well, you’re always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","So take me with you when you go back.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BENJEN","Jon…","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BENJEN","The Wall isn’t going anywhere.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","I’m ready to swear your oath.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BENJEN","You don’t understand what you’d be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","I don’t care about that.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BENJEN","You might, if you knew what it meant. … I’d better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We’ll talk later.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","Your uncle’s in the Night’s Watch.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","What’re you doing back there?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION (drinking)","Preparing for a night with your family. I’ve always wanted to see the Wall.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","You’re Tyrion Lannister. The queen’s brother?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","My greatest accomplishment. You – you’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","Lord Eddard Stark is my father.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JON","What the hell do you know about being a bastard?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","All dwarves are bastards in their fathers’ eyes.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BENJEN","You at a feast -- It’s like a bear in a trap.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BENJEN","Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BENJEN","The two he was with are still missing.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","A wildling ambush.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BENJEN","Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Winter is coming.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBB","Uncle Benjen.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BENJEN","Robb boy. How are ye?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBB","I’m good.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI","Yes. Lovely country.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","I’m sure it’s very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI","Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"SANSA","Thirteen, Your Grace.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI","You’re tall. Still growing?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"SANSA","I think so, Your Grace.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI","And have you bled yet?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"SANSA (discomfited)","No, Your Grace.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI","And your dress. Did you make it?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI","Such talent. You must make something for me.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI (to CATELYN]","I hear we might share a grandchild someday.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","I hear the same.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI","Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn’t stay hidden up here forever.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Your pardon.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it’s true.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","I’m sure we’ll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","I don’t fight in tournaments.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","No? Getting a little old for it?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","I don’t fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don’t want him to know what I can do.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","Well said.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"SANSA","Arya!","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBB","Time for bed.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","I’m a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat’s nest they call a capital.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","I won’t let him take you.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","The king takes what he wants. That’s why he’s king.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","I’ll say, ‘Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.’","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","How did he get so fat?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","He only stops eating when it’s time for a drink.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"A VOICE","It’s Maester Luwin, my lord.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Send him in.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"LUWIN","Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","Stay.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","This was sent from the Eyrie. What’s she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn’t been back there since her wedding.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","What news?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","She’s fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was m*rder. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","She’s fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn’t know what she’s saying.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","Lysa’s head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son’s life, if she wasn’t certain her husband was m*rder?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"LUWIN","If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","They m*rder the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"LUWIN","The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark’s help. He’s the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CATELYN","He spent half his life fighting Robert’s wars. He owes him nothing. (To NED) Your father and brother rode south once on a king’s demand.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"LUWIN","A different time. Different king.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS","When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ILLYRIO","If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS","When?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ILLYRIO","When their omens favor w*r.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS","I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ILLYRIO","A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JORAH","A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"DAENERYS","Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JORAH","Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ILLYRIO","Dragons’ eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"DAENERYS","Thank you, Magister.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"DAENERYS","She’s beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don’t know how to say ‘thank you’ in Dothraki.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JORAH","There is no word for ‘thank you’ in Dothraki.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"VISERYS","Make him happy.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"KHAL DROGO","No.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"DAENERYS","Do you know the Common Tongue?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"KHAL DROGO","No.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"DAENERYS","Is ‘no’ the only word that you know?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"KHAL DROGO","No.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"THE HOUND","Rough night, Imp?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"THE HOUND","I didn’t pick you for a hunter.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"TYRION","The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"THE HOUND","It’s not hunting if you pay for it.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","No, but I’m still better than you.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","I know what I’m putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You’re a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I’ve got.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"NED","I hope I’ll serve you well.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"ROBERT","You will. And I’ll make sure you don’t look so f*cking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let’s go k*ll some boar!","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BRAN","Come on, you.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI","Stop. STOP.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","Are you completely mad?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI","He saw us.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","It’s all right. It’s all right.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"CERSEI","He saw us!","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","I heard you the first time. (To BRAN) Quite the little climber, aren’t you? How old are you, boy?","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"BRAN","Ten","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","Ten.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"JAIME","The things I do for love.","01","01","Winter is Coming"
"Ned","A Wildling ambush.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jorah Mormont ","You need to drink, child. And eat.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","Isn't there anything else ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jorah Mormont ","The Dothraki have two things in abundance   grass and horses. People can't live on grass. In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night. It m*rder all other grass. The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything. That's the way the world will end. It'll get easier.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Doreah ","Khaleesi !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Irri ","Your hands.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jorah Mormont ","We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Viserys Targaryen ","I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jorah Mormont ","As you wish, your Grace.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Viserys Targaryen ","Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for ? Buying from a slaver ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jorah Mormont ","Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Viserys Targaryen ","Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","What good will my sympathies do them ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","One word and I'll hit you again.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","I'm telling mother !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Go ! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","You can't...","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Do you understand ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sandor Clegane ","The Prince will remember that, little lord.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast. Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burned black.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jaime Lannister ","Little brother.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Beloved siblings.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Myrcella Baratheon ","Is Bran going to die ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Apparently not.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","What do you mean ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","The Maester says the boy may live.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Where's your sense of wonder ? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jaime Lannister ","Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","And go celibate ? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jaime Lannister ","Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jaime Lannister ","My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","Please.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","I would have dressed, your Grace.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he ? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to b*at the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","I never knew.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","It was years ago. Robert was crazed, b*at his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care. The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","I am grateful.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","Perhaps this time she'll listen.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jaime Lannister ","A sword for the wall ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","I already have one.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jaime Lannister ","Good man. Have you swung it yet ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","Of course I have.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jaime Lannister ","At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","We've guarded the kingdoms for 8 000 years.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jaime Lannister ","Is it ""we"" already ? Have you taken your vows then ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","Soon enough.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jaime Lannister ","Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not ? It's only for life.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. My things weren't properly folded, she says. Who cares how they're folded ?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","It's good you've got help.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","Watch. Nymeria, gloves.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","Impressive.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","Shut up. Nymeria, gloves !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","A present ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","It's so skinny.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","I can be quick.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel ? Do you like the balance ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","I think so.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","First lesson  Stick them with the pointy end.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","I know which end to use.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","I'm going to miss you. Careful. All the best swords have names, you know.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","I came to say goodbye to Bran.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","You've said it.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","I want you to leave. 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","I have no choice.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","You can. You must.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robb Stark ","You've said goodbye to Bran ? He's not going to die. I know it.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","You Starks are hard to k*ll.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robb Stark ","My mother ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","She was very kind.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robb Stark ","Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","It was always my color.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robb Stark ","Farewell, Snow.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","And you, Stark.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","Is my mother alive ? Does she know about me ? Where I am, where I'm going ? Does she care ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","Gods, this is country ! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","I've half a mind to go with you.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","You should have asked me 20 years ago.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","I recall a few chances.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","There was that one... Oh, what was her name ? That common girl of yours ? Becca ? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","Bessie. She was one of yours.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","Bessie ! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena ? No. You told me once. Meryl ? Your bastard's mother ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","Wylla.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","Nor will I.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","We were at w*r. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it ? Should we send her a wedding gift ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","A kn*fe perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","She's little more than a child.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","Tell me we're not speaking of this.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","Oh, it's unspeakable to you ? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll k*ll every Targaryen I get my hands on.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","But you can't get your hands on this one, can you ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100 000 men in his horde.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","There's a w*r coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Benjen Stark ","Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the kn*fe. Not impressed by your new brothers ? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","Why do you read so much ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Look at me and tell me what you see.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","Is this a trick ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","Until your brother k*ll that King.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Until my brother k*ll him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree ? But how ? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you ? What's your story, bastard ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jon Snow ","The Night's Watch protects the realm from...","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense. Everything's better with some wine in the belly.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Maester Luwin ","It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","Talk to Poole about it.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Maester Luwin ","Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention...","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","I don't care about appointments !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robb Stark ","I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Maester Luwin ","Very good, my Lord. My Lady.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robb Stark ","When was the last time you left this room ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","I have to take care of him.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robb Stark ","He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","What if he's wrong ? Bran needs me.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robb Stark ","Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying...","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","Close the windows ! I can't stand it ! Please make them stop !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robb Stark ","Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Man ","You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","No !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","Have you ever seen a dragon ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Irri ","Dragon gone, Khaleesi.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","Everywhere ? Even in the east ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Irri ","No dragon. Brave men k*ll them. It is known.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jhiqui ","It is known.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Doreah ","A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","The moon ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Doreah ","He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Irri ","Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jhiqui ","It is known.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Doreah ","Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","How old were you ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Doreah ","I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","Nine ?!","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Doreah ","I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Doreah ","Yes.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","Will it take three years ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Doreah ","No.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Benjen Stark ","Welcome.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Maester Luwin ","The boy was always sure-footed before.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","Someone tried to k*ll him twice. Why ? Why m*rder an innocent child ? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Theon Greyjoy ","Saw what, my lady ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Rodrick Cassel ","Did you notice the dagger the k*ll used ? It's too fine a w*apon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robb Stark ","They come into our home and try to m*rder my brother ? If it's w*r they want...","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Theon Greyjoy ","If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Maester Luwin ","What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood ? Too easily words of w*r become acts of w*r. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","I don't trust a raven to carry these words.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robb Stark ","I'll ride to King's Landing.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robb Stark ","Mother, you can't.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","I must.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Rodrick Cassel ","I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Rodrick Cassel ","Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robb Stark ","What about Bran ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Catelyn Stark ","I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Doreah ","No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","Finish a man ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Doreah ","Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Doreah ","You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi ? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Doreah ","If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sansa Stark ","Pardon me, Ser.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sandor Clegane ","Do I frighten you so much, girl ? Or is it him there making you shake ? He frightens me too. Look at that face.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sansa Stark ","I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sandor Clegane ","He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady ? Does the hound frighten you ? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sansa Stark ","Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Mycah ","I'll get you !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sansa Stark ","Arya !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","What are you doing here ? Go away.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","Your sister ? And who are you, boy ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Mycah ","Mycah, my Lord.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sansa Stark ","He the butcher's boy.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","He's my friend.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh ? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Mycah ","She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Mycah ","It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","Stop it !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sansa Stark ","Arya, stay out of this.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sansa Stark ","No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","I'll gut you, you little c**t !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sansa Stark ","Arya !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","Nymeria !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","Please don't.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sansa Stark ","Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","Then go ! Don't touch me.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Soldier 1 ","The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","You've got to go. They'll k*ll you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go ! Leave now !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Soldier 2 ","It's a direwolf.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Soldier 1 ","I'll check down here.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Soldier 2 ","I think I heard a noise.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","Go !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jory Cassel ","My lord ! My lord ! They found her. She's unharmed.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","Where is she ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jory Cassel ","She's been taken directly before the King.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","Who took her ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jory Cassel ","The Lannisters found her.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","Right, get back.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Jory Cassel ","The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","Back ! Back to the inn. All back !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","I'm sorry.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","Are you hurt ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","No.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","It's all right. What is the meaning of this ? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","How dare you speak to your King in that manner ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","That's not true ! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","Joff told us what happened. You and that boy b*at him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","That's not what happened !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","Yes it is ! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","Liar !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","Shut up !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","Enough ! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells ! What am I to make of this ? Where's your other daughter, Ned ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","In bed asleep.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","She's not. Sansa, come here, darling.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sansa Stark ","I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","Liar ! Liar liar liar !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sansa Stark ","Arya !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","Stop it ! That's enough of that.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","Liar liar liar !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","Stop ! Arya !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","What would you have me do, whip her through the streets ? Damn it, children fight. It's over.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","You let that little girl disarm you ? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","Gladly, your Grace.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","And what of the direwolf ? What of the beast that savaged your son ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","I'd forgot the damned wolf.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Soldier ","We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","So be it.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","We have another wolf.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","As you will.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","You can't mean it.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Robert Baratheon ","A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sansa Stark ","He doesn't mean Lady, does he ? No no, not Lady ! Lady didn't bite anyone ! She's good !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Arya Stark ","Lady wasn't there ! You leave her alone !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sansa Stark ","Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please ! It wasn't Lady !","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","Is this your command... your Grace ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","Where is the beast ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Soldier ","Chained up outside, your Grace.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Cersei Baratheon ","Is this some trick ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Eddard Stark ","The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher. The butcher's boy... You rode him down ?","01","02","The Kings Road"
"Sandor Clegane ","He ran... Not very fast.","01","02","The Kings Road"
"First lesson","Stick them with the pointy end.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"King’s Landing Page ","Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jory Cassel ","Yes, my Lord.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"King’s Landing Page ","If you'd like to change into something more appropriate...","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Glad to see you're protecting the throne.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder ? What's the line ? The King shits and the Hand wipes.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","You've chosen your opponents wisely then.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","But you just stood there and watched.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger ? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Is that what you tell yourself at night ? You're a servant of justice ? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","You served him well when serving was safe.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Varys ","Lord Stark.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Lord Varys.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Varys ","I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly ! You're looking well.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Renly Baratheon ","And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but...","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Grand Maester Pycelle ","I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Grand Maester.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Grand Maester Pycelle ","How many years has it been ? You were a young man.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","And you served another King.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Grand Maester Pycelle ","How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Without the King ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Renly Baratheon ","Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Varys ","His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","We are the lords of small matters here.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Renly Baratheon ","My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","Mmm, how much ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","40 000 gold dragons to the champion, 20 000 to the runner-up, 20 000 to the winning archer.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Grand Maester Pycelle ","Can the treasury bear such expense ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80 000 ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","How could you let this happen ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Grand Maester Pycelle ","Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Renly Baratheon ","""Counting coppers,"" he calls it.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Varys ","You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","Please, it's nearly healed.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","It's ugly.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","That's not true. You k*ll the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","Do I have to marry her ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather f*ck painted whores, you'll f*ck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","I don't want to.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","How would you handle them ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10 000 men to the royal army.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","A royal army ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","Why should every lord command his own men ? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","And if the northerners rebel ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","And these 10 000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","For me. I'm their King.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to k*ll their brothers.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","I'm not asking.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Joffrey Baratheon ","So you agree... The Starks are enemies ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Septa Mordane ","Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","I'm practicing.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Sansa Stark ","Practicing for what ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","The Prince.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Septa Mordane ","Arya, stop !","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","He's a liar and a coward and he k*ll my friend.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Sansa Stark ","The Hound k*ll your friend.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Sansa Stark ","You're an idiot.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Septa Mordane ","Enough !","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","What's happening here ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Septa Mordane ","Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love. The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Sansa Stark ","I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Septa Mordane ","You've barely eaten a thing.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","It's all right. Go on. w*r was easier than daughters.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","Go away !","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Arya, open the door. May I come in ? Whose sword is that ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","Mine.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this ? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Come here. Now what do you want with this ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","It's called Needle.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle ? Your sister ? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","Stick 'em with the pointy end.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","That's the essence of it.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","No, sweet girl. You didn't k*ll the butcher's boy.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","I hate them ! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","So was I ! He is a liar.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","But how you can let her marry someone like that ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","Winter is coming.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","I don't hate her. Not really.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a w*r amongst ourselves. All right ? Go on. It's yours.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","I can keep it ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Old Nan ","Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Bran Stark ","I hate your stories.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Old Nan ","I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Bran Stark ","Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Old Nan ","Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear ? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like ? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds...","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Robb Stark ","What are you telling him now ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Old Nan ","Only what the little Lord wants to hear.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Robb Stark ","Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Bran Stark ","Maybe we do.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Robb Stark ","How do you feel ? You still don't remember anything ? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Bran Stark ","I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs ? I'd rather be dead.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Robb Stark ","Don't ever say that.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Bran Stark ","I'd rather be dead.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Rodrick Cassel ","Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Rodrick Cassel ","My Lady.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Guard ","Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","I would. We've done nothing wrong.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Guard ","We've been instructed to escort you into the city.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","Instructed ? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but...","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Guard ","Follow me, Lady Stark.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","Cat ! Go on. Go upstairs.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","You little worm ! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a...","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","I meant no disrespect to you of all people.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","How dare you bring me here ! Have you lost your mind ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted ? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","How did you know I was coming to King's Landing ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","A dear friend told me.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Varys ","Lady Stark.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","Lord Varys.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Varys ","To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","How did you know I was coming ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Varys ","Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance ? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","Do you know whose dagger this is ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Varys ","I must admit I do not.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","Yours ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","To whom ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Alliser Thorne ","Grenn, show him what you farm boys are made of. If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us ? Next ! Next ! Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","A charming man.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jeor Mormont ","I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","And how's that going, Commander Mormont ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jeor Mormont ","Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Good news or bad ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jeor Mormont ","Both.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Grand Maester Pycelle ","Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","Good news ? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","My wife is in Winterfell.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","Is she ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","You're a funny man. A very funny man.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","Ned !","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Grenn ","You broke my nose, bastard !","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jon Snow ","It's an improvement.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Grenn ","If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Pyp ","I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Grenn ","What're you looking at, Half Man ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Rast ","What do you care about our faces ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","It's just I think they would look marvellous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Grenn ","We'll talk later, Lord Snow.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jon Snow ","Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice  his right hand or the Wall. I've been asking the Lord Commander about them. Fascinating stories.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jon Snow ","They hate me because I'm better than they are.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to k*ll your boy would be considered treason.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","We have proof. We have the blade.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","I won't forget this. You're a true friend.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Petyr Baelish ","Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","How could you be so stupid ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","Calm down.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","Then what are you raving about ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","What if it comes back to him ? If he tells his father what he saw...","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","And my husband ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","I'll go to w*r with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us   ""The w*r for Cersei's c**t.""","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","Let me go.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","Never.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","Let me go.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll k*ll him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","I wish I could see the girls.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","It's too dangerous.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","Just for a moment.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Until we know who our enemies are...","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Cersei Baratheon ","And if you find the proof ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh ? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","My temper ? Gods be good, you nearly k*ll poor Littlefinger yesterday.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","He still loves you.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Catelyn Stark ","Does he ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Eddard Stark ","Off with you.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Robert Baratheon ","It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Barristan Selmy ","Of course, your Grace.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Robert Baratheon ","Who was it ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Barristan Selmy ","A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Robert Baratheon ","How'd you do it ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Barristan Selmy ","Lance through the heart.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Robert Baratheon ","Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait ! Wait."" They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine ! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you ? Some halfwit with a stutter ? What are you doing ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Lancel Lannister ","It's empty, your Grace.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Robert Baratheon ","What do you mean it's empty ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Lancel Lannister ","There's no more wine.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Robert Baratheon ","Is that what empty means ? So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer ! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh ? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and f*ck. So come on. We're telling w*r stories. Who was your first k*ll, not counting old men ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Barristan Selmy ","I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","You k*ll Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Barristan Selmy ","A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Robert Baratheon ","Your outlaw... Any last words ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","I cut his head off, so no.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Robert Baratheon ","What about Aerys Targaryen ? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back ? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor ? Did he plead for a reprieve ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jaime Lannister ","He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace...","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jorah Mormont ","The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","From whom ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jorah Mormont ","If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices   pay tribute or fight. An easy choice for most. Of course, sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given. He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly. Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","Tell them all to stop.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jorah Mormont ","You want the entire horde to stop ? For how long ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","Until I command them otherwise.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jorah Mormont ","You're learning to talk like a Queen.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Viserys Targaryen ","You dare ! You give commands to me ? To me ? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Irri ","Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","No !","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Irri ","Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Viserys Targaryen ","k*ll these Dothraki dogs ! I am your King !","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jorah Mormont ","Shall we return to the Khalasar ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Rakharo ","You walk.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Benjen Stark ","I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jon Snow ","You're leaving ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Benjen Stark ","I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jon Snow ","What kind of reports ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Benjen Stark ","The kind I don't want to believe.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jon Snow ","I'm ready. I won't let you down.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Benjen Stark ","You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jon Snow ","But I'm better than every...","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Benjen Stark ","Better than no one ! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Yoren ","A bear's balls.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","You're joking ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Yoren ","And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","And how do a bear's balls taste ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Yoren ","A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord ? What's the strangest thing you've eaten ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Do Dornish girls count ? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Yoren ","But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","They have a better chance finding feed than glory.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Benjen Stark ","The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it ? Is that what we are, Lannister ? An army of jesters in black ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Benjen Stark ","I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Do you think I'm plump ? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Benjen Stark ","Call me what you like.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Benjen Stark ","You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Benjen Stark ","You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to k*ll them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Yoren ","Are you going below ? Keep well, keep warm.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Benjen Stark ","Enjoy the capital, brother.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Yoren ","I always do.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below"" ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Yoren ","Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","So you're heading down to King's Landing too.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Yoren ","Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Yoren ","I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Irri ","Yes, Khaleesi.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","What are you doing ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Irri ","When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi ? You change, Khaleesi. It’s a blessing from the Great Stallion.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jorah Mormont ","For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good w*apon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Rakharo ","Dothraki don’t wear steel dresses.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jorah Mormont ","Armor.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Rakharo ","Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jorah Mormont ","Slow.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Rakharo ","Slow.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jorah Mormont ","It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Rakharo ","My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jorah Mormont ","I’ve heard that your father was a famous warrior.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Rakharo ","He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal ? He was a warrior also ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jorah Mormont ","He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Irri ","The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. k*ll some rabbits.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Rakharo ","There are no rabbits.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Irri ","Find some ducks, she likes ducks.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Rakharo ","Have you seen any ducks, woman ? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head ? Do you ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Irri ","Dog then. I have seen many dogs.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jorah Mormont ","I don't think she wants to eat dog.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Irri ","The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Rakharo ","A blessing from the Great Stallion.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Irri ","She does not want to eat horse.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jorah Mormont ","I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Rhakaro ","We ride for Vaes Dothrak.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jorah Mormont ","Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jon Snow ","Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Maester Aemon ","How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Eight... no, nine.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Maester Aemon ","All of them brief ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Maester Aemon ","This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually   winter is coming. This one will be long and dark things will come with it.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jeor Mormont ","We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jeor Mormont ","One of our own rangers swore he saw them k*ll his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Maester Aemon ","The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jeor Mormont ","Your sister sits by the side the King. Tell her we need help.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Maester Aemon ","When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","It’s a boy.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Khal Drogo ","How do you know ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Daenerys Targaryen ","I know.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jon Snow ","I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jon Snow ","Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jon Snow ","If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","Of course.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jon Snow ","He'll never walk again.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Tyrion Lannister ","If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Jon Snow ","Farewell, My Lord.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Syrio Forel ","You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","Who are you ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Syrio Forel ","Your dancing master, Syrio Forel. Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","It's too heavy.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Syrio Forel ","It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body sideface. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","What if I drop it ?","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Syrio Forel ","The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm ? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","I'm a girl.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Syrio Forel ","Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding...","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Arya Stark ","A needle.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Syrio Forel ","Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this ? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me. Up ! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster.","01","03","Lord Snow"
"Littlefinger","I do.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Old Nan","The little Lord's been dreaming again.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Theon Greyjoy","We have visitors.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Bran Stark","I don't want to see anyone.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Theon Greyjoy","Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Bran Stark","I don't want to go.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Theon Greyjoy","Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! Help Bran down the hall.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Robb Stark","Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Robb Stark","I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","Then you might learn a lord's courtesy. So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Maester Luwin","He has no memory of that day.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","Curious.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Robb Stark","Why are you here?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Bran Stark","Kneel, Hodor.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","Do you like to ride, Bran?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Bran Stark","Yes. Well, I mean I did like to.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Maester Luwin","The boy has lost the use of his legs.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Bran Stark","I'm not a cripple.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Bran Stark","Will I really be able to ride?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Robb Stark","Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Robb Stark","You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Theon Greyjoy","Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Theon Greyjoy","He's not my master.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Theon Greyjoy","She wasn't feeling well.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Theon Greyjoy","My lady's whereabouts...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Theon Greyjoy","Must have been a pretty sight.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Theon Greyjoy","We were outnumbered 10 to one.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Theon Greyjoy","Careful, Imp.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grenn","What in seven hells is that?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Pyp","They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Alliser Thorne","Tell them your name.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Rast","Come to take the black pudding.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Alliser Thorne","Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. See what he can do.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","I yield. Please, no more.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Alliser Thorne","On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","Enough! He yielded.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Alliser Thorne","Looks like the bastard's in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","Are you sure you want to do this?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grenn","No. Yield yield yield! I yield.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Alliser Thorne","We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Pyp","Well fought!","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grenn","Piss off.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","Did he hurt you?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","I've had worse.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grenn","Why didn't you get up and fight?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","I wanted to. I just couldn't.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grenn","Why not?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","I'm a coward. My father always says so.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","The Wall's no place for cowards.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grenn","A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Pyp","You're too stupid to be a coward.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grenn","You're too stupid to be a...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Pyp","Quick now, before summer's over.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grenn","Come on here!","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jorah Mormont","Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs - best these savages can do.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jorah Mormont","The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","But if they did?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jorah Mormont","King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","And you know these men?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jorah Mormont","I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","You sold slaves. Why?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jorah Mormont","I had no money and an expensive wife.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","And where is she now?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jorah Mormont","In another place, with another man.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Doreah","Your Grace?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","Yes, my dear?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Doreah","They call you the last dragon...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","They do.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Doreah","You have dragon's blood in your veins?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","It's entirely possible.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Doreah","What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men k*ll them all.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","The brave men didn't k*ll dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Doreah","I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","Really? Why dragons?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Doreah","They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can k*ll. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Doreah","I was not locked in. I have seen things.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","What have you seen?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Doreah","I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","A pirate ship?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Doreah","A dragon.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen  their skulls. They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep. When I was very young, just 3 or 4, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him. When I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet. The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong. Skulls no bigger than dog skulls. But as you got closer to the Iron Throne... They got bigger and bigger and bigger. There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius, Archonel, Meraxes, Vhagar... And Balerion the Dread... whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Doreah","What happened to the skulls?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Doreah","That's very sad.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Doreah","No, your Grace. To teach your sister.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Septa Mordane","Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","What if I have a girl?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Septa Mordane","Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","What if I only have girls?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Septa Mordane","I wouldn't worry about that.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Septa Mordane","Yes, but it's highly unlikely.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","But what if?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Septa Mordane","If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","And everyone would hate me.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Septa Mordane","Nobody could ever hate you.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","Joffrey does.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Septa Mordane","Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","Please shut up about it.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Septa Mordane","Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","Aegon the Conqueror.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Septa Mordane","And who built the Red Keep?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","Maegor the Cruel.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Septa Mordane","And how many years did it take to build...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","My grandfather and uncle were m*rder here, weren't they?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Septa Mordane","They were k*ll on the orders of King Aerys, yes.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","The Mad King.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Septa Mordane","Commonly known as the Mad King.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","Why were they k*ll?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Septa Mordane","You should be speak to your father about these matters.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","I don't want to speak to my father, ever.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Septa Mordane","You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","No, I won't.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Janos Slynt","It's the Hand's tournament that's causing all this trouble, my Lords.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","The King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Janos Slynt","Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Varys","Dreadful.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Renly Baratheon","If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Janos Slynt","I need more men.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","I will?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Janos Slynt","Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser. They will be put to good use.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","The sooner this is over, the better.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Varys","The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grand Maester Pycelle","This heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows. Until tomorrow my Lord.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grand Maester Pycelle","Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Why?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grand Maester Pycelle","I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","What did Jon want the night before he died?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grand Maester Pycelle","He came inquiring after a book.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","A book? What book?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grand Maester Pycelle","I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","I'd like to read it.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grand Maester Pycelle","""The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children.""","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","""Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.""","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grand Maester Pycelle","As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grand Maester Pycelle","He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Jon's death...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grand Maester Pycelle","Such a tragedy.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Did he say anything to you during his final hours?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grand Maester Pycelle","Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating  ""The seed is strong,"" I think it was.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","""The seed is strong""? What does that mean?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grand Maester Pycelle","The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grand Maester Pycelle","What else could it be?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Poison.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grand Maester Pycelle","A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","I've heard it said that poison is a woman's w*apon.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grand Maester Pycelle","Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Everybody knows that.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grand Maester Pycelle","Of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","I've taken enough of your time.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grand Maester Pycelle","No trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Thank you. I'll find my own way out.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Arya Stark","Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","It's a hard fall down these steps.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Arya Stark","Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Cats? Syrio says…","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Arya Stark","He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","He's right about that.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Arya Stark","Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","He needs to get his strength back first.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Arya Stark","He wants to be a knight of the King’s Guard. He can't be one now, can he?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Arya Stark","Can I be Lord of a holdfast?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Arya Stark","No. That's not me.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","No, that's all right. I'm fine.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","You're not. You're freezing.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","I don't like high places.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. ""You're almost a man now,"" he said, ""but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not,"" he said, ""then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more."" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","Yes, he is.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","I'm not going to get any better, you know?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","Well… You can't get any worse.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","I hear you're reading a boring book.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Pycelle talks too much.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","I promised Cat that I'd help you.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Varys or the Queen?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Yes.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Why?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Hugh of the Vale","As you can see, I'm busy.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Hugh of the Vale","I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","No ""ser."" I'm not a knight.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Hugh of the Vale","I see. Well, it just so happens that I am.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Let them look.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tobho Mott","The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","What did Lord Arryn want?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tobho Mott","He always came to see the boy.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","I'd like to see him as well.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tobho Mott","As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","This is fine work.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Gendry","It's not for sale.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tobho Mott","Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Gendry","I made it for me.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tobho Mott","Forgive him, my Lord.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Gendry","He just asked me questions is all, my Lord.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","What kind of questions?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Gendry","About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Your mother?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Gendry","Who she was, what she looked like.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","What did you tell him?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Gendry","She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","Find anything?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","King Robert's bastard son.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","This is for the King from Lord Stark.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jaime Lannister","Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","Three? Four?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jaime Lannister","He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","Forgive me, my Lord...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jaime Lannister","Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","We've met before, you know.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jaime Lannister","Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jaime Lannister","That's where you got your scar?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jaime Lannister","Vicious sons of whores.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","They like their bloodshed.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jaime Lannister","They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jaime Lannister","I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","Theon? He's a good lad.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jaime Lannister","I doubt it.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Robert Baratheon","I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jaime Lannister","I don't serve Lord Stark.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grenn","Where have you been?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","Watch duty. With Sam.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Pyp","Prince Porkchop. Where is he?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","He wasn't hungry.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Pyp","Impossible!","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Rast","You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","No one touches Sam.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Alliser Thorne","What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Grenn","Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Alliser Thorne","You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Doreah","Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Irri","Yes, Khaleesi.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","Why did you hit her?!","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","What's this?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","It's a gift. I had it made for you.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","Please.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","This stinks of manure. All of it.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","Stop - stop it.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Viserys Targaryen","You do not talk back to me! You are a horselord's slut. And now you've woken the dragon...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","I wouldn't doubt it.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","Sally on the side?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","I find that hard to believe.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","You didn't know where to put it?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","I know where to put it.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","Was she... Old and ugly?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","What color hair?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","Red.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","I like red hair. And her... Her...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","You don't want to know.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","That good?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","Better.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","What's my name?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","Jon Snow?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","And why is my surname Snow?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","Because... You're a bastard from the north.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","So... You didn't know where to put it?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Alliser Thorne","Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Samwell Tarly","It is a bit nippy.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Alliser Thorne","A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jon Snow","I build my own fires.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Alliser Thorne","That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","I hit him. I hit the dragon.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jorah Mormont","Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","He is still the true King.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jorah Mormont","The truth now  do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jorah Mormont","The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jorah Mormont","Home.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Daenerys Targaryen","I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","Lover's quarrel?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","I'm sorry. Do I...?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Septa Mordane","Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known...","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Arya Stark","Why do they call you Littlefinger?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","Arya!","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Septa Mordane","Don't be rude!","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Robert Baratheon","I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","Gods, who is that?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Hound's older brother.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","And his opponent?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Robert Baratheon","Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Sansa Stark","I won't tell anyone. I promise.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Petyr Baelish","No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Jory Cassel","My Lord, Her Grace the Queen.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Your Grace.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Cersei Baratheon","You're missing your tournament.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Cersei Baratheon","I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to k*ll the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","She likes it here.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Cersei Baratheon","The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","What are you doing here?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Cersei Baratheon","I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Cersei Baratheon","You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","If that's my job, then so be it.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Cersei Baratheon","You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Eddard Stark","I was also trained to k*ll my enemies, Your Grace.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Cersei Baratheon","As was I.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Marillion","Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Catelyn Stark","And to you.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Rodrick Cassel","Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Marillion","Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Rodrick Cassel","I'd rather throw myself down a well.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Marillion","Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Masha Heddle","I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Masha Heddle","Truly, my lord, we have nothing.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Bronn","You can have my room.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Yoren","Aye, my Lord.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Marillion","My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Masha Heddle","Lady Stark.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Catelyn Stark","I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Knight of House Whent","It is, my Lady.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Catelyn Stark","And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Knight of House Whent","She is.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Catelyn Stark","The Red Stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Knight of House Bracken","Our lord is honored by his trust.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Tyrion Lannister","I envy your father all his fine friends... but I don't quite see the purpose of this.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Catelyn Stark","I know your sigil as well... The twin towers of Frey. How fares your Lord, Ser?","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Knight of House Frey","Lord Walder is well, my Lady. He has asked your father for the honor of his presence on his 90th nameday. He plans to take another wife.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"Catelyn Stark","This man... came into my house as a guest and there conspired to m*rder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the King's justice.","01","04","Cripples Bastards and Broken Things"
"In this episode","Catelyn has captured Tyrion and plans to bring him to her sister, Lysa Arryn, at The Vale, to be tried for his, supposed, crimes against Bran. Robert plans to have Daenerys k*ll, but Eddard refuses to be a part of it and quits.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BARRISTAN","No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","He'd never worn this armor before.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BARRISTAN","Bad luck for him ... going against the Mountain.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Who determines the draw?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BARRISTAN","All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Aye ... but who holds the straws? (addressing the body's attendants) You've done good work, sisters.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BARRISTAN","Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan ... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BARRISTAN","(chuckles) You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BARRISTAN","He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","(pointing back to Ser Hugh's tent) And that lad ... he was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BARRISTAN","Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Yes. That will never happen.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BARRISTAN","(chuckles) Robert tends to do what he wants.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LANCEL","It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat ass. Did you know that? (addressing Ned) Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","You're too fat for your armor.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? (King Robert and Ned Laugh. King Robert turns to Lancel who is grinning.)That was funny, is it?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LANCEL","No, Your Grace.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","No? You don't like the Hand's joke?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","You're torturing the poor boy.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher -- now!","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","the breastplate stretcher?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","How long before he figures it out?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Maybe you should have one invented.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","And who's going to hit you back?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle ... will be you!","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Aye.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","(pours Ned a drink and offers it to him) Drink.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","I'm not thirsty.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Your squire ... a Lannister boy?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","hmm ... a bloody idiot ... but Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. ""Cersei Lannister will make a good match"", he told me. ""You'll need her father on your side."" I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood. (The king rises and starts to leave the tent.)","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Robert?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","What? (Looking down, King Robert sees his naked fat belly protruding from his jacket) (laughing) Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Where's Arya","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"SANSA","At her dancing lessons. (Sansa looks up the jousting track.) The Knight of the Flowers. (aka Ser Loras Tyrell, who rides up to Sansa and hands her a rose.)","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"SANSA","Thank you, Ser Loras.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"SANSA","(grabbing her father's arm) Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Hey.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"SANSA","I can't watch.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","(turned around and speaking to Renly) 100 gold dragons on the Mountain.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","I'll take that bet.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","Or you could even buy a friend.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"SANSA","(to Ned) He's going to die.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Ser Loras rides well.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend? (indicating Loras)","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","(now seated, leans forward, speaking to Ned) Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"SANSA","Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","No honor but quite a bit of gold.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","(rising, shouts) Stop this madness in the name of your King!","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","I owe you my life, Ser.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"SANDOR","I'm no Ser.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CATELYN","Remove his hood.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"MARILLION","(singing) On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"TYRION","This isn't the Kings Road. You said we were riding for Winterfell.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CATELYN","I did ... often and loudly.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"TYRION","Very wise. (Tyrion begins turning in circles, making sure to make eye contact as he speaks.) They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Word's probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CATELYN","And why would I do that?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"TYRION","Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would k*ll me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CATELYN","Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"TYRION","Ah ... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CATELYN","Five years ago.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"TYRION","She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now ... you might as well k*ll me here.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CATELYN","I am not a m*rder, Lannister.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"TYRION","Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CATELYN","The dagger found","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"TYRION","What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RODRIK","Should I gag him?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"TYRION","Why? Am I starting to make sense?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RODRIK","My Lady, this way.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"TYRION","Untie me. If I die, what's the point?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CATELYN","Rodrik?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RODRIK","I'll be fine, My Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRONN","Your first? (Tyrion nods.) You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"TYRION","(looking at Catelyn) Well, I'm willing if she is.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","Bran ... (Maester Luwin taps a pointer on a map of Westeros.)","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","The Iron Islands. Sigil -- a Kraken. Words -- ""We do not sow"".","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","Lords?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","The Greyjoys.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"THEON","(turns to face Bran) Famed for their k*ll at archery, navigation and lovemaking.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","And failed rebellions. (Maester Luwin taps again.)","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","Sigil -- a stag. -- a crowned stag now that Robert's King.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","Good.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","Words -- ""Ours is the fury"". Lords -- the Baratheons.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","mm - hmm.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","The Westerlands -- sigil -- a lion.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","hmm ..","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","Words -- ""A Lannister always pays his debts.""","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","No. A common saying, but not their official motto.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","Lords -- the Lannisters.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","We're still on their words.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","I don't know them.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","You do know them. Think.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","""Unbowed, unbent, unbroken"".","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","That's House Martell.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","""Righteous in wrath"".","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","House Hornwood.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","""Family, duty, honor"".","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","Those are Tully words ... your mother's. Are we playing a game?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","""Family, duty, honor"" ... is that the right order?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","You know it is.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","Family comes first?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","And then she left!","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","Why did she leave?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","Do you know where she is now? Today?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","No, I don't.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","I'll never sh**t another arrow.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","And where is that written?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","You need legs to work a bow.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","hmm ... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to sh**t a bow from horseback.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRAN","Really?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LUWIN","Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"THEON","Shh ... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ROS","I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"THEON","Important enough for the likes of you.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ROS","You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"THEON","Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ROS","Jealous?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"THEON","Why should I be jealous?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"THEON","Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ROS","Might surprise you.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"THEON","hmm?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ROS","He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"THEON","(grabs the necklace around Ros's neck) Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ROS","You are jealous.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"THEON","I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ARYA","Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","How is your son, My Lord?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","He'll never walk again.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","But his mind is sound?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","So they say.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever ... others open in the most unexpected places. May I? (Varys indicates a chair and with a nod from Ned, sits down.)","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool ... your friend, I know, but a fool ... and doomed unless you save him.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","I didn't trust you.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","So why do you trust me now?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","What sort of doom does the King face?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Who gave it to him?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy ... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","(turning to look at Vayrs) The squire, Ser Hugh?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","Someone who could afford it.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why k*ll him?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","He started asking questions.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ILLYRIO","And when he knows the truth, what will he do?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","The gods alone know. The fools tried to k*ll his son. What's worse -- they botched it. (Varys closes and locks the corridor gate.) The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at w*r soon, my friend.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ILLYRIO","What good is w*r now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","This Hand is not the other.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ILLYRIO","We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","""Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ILLYRIO","It never was.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","You do move quietly.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","We all have our qualities.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear ... such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion -- both equally important.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone ... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","Strictly speaking.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","Saw me with your own eyes?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","Eyes I own.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion ... To think a simple word to the Queen ...","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","One shudders at the thought.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","Ooh. (shudders)","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","Have you?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","Was that you under the bed?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary ... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies -- to stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right -- loyalty to the realm.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","Oh, please.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming. (exits)","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","To a small council meeting?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VAYRS","Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"GUARD1","Off with you. No begging.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ARYA","I'm not a beggar. I live here.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"GUARD1","D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ARYA","I want to see my father.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"GUARD2","I want to f*ck the Queen, for all the good it does me.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"GUARD1","You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ARYA","My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ARYA","They said they were going to k*ll you.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Who did?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ARYA","I didn't see them, but I think one was fat.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Oh, Arya.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ARYA","I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage ... something about the savage.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Where did you hear this?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ARYA","In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","What were you doing in the dungeons?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ARYA","Chasing a cat.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"JORY","(guard knocks, then enters) Pardon, My Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent. (Ned nods, the visitor enters.)","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Your name, friend?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"YOREN","Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ARYA","I'm a girl!","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Did Benjen send you?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"YOREN","No one sent me, My Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Ah, we'll find recruits for you.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"YOREN","Thank you, My Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen ... his blood runs black -- makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near k*ll my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Know what?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"YOREN","Best said in private, My Lord.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","(kisses Arya on the head) Go on. We'll talk more later.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Jory, take her safely to her room.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"JORY","Come along, My Lady. You heard your father.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ARYA","How many guards does my father have?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"JORY","Here in King's Landing? Fifty.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ARYA","You wouldn't let anyone k*ll him, would you?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"JORY","No fear on that count, little Lady.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Well?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"YOREN","It's about your wife, My Lord. She's taken the Imp.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VARDIS","You're far from home, Lady Stark.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CATELYN","To whom do I speak?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VARDIS","Ser Vardis Egan, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CATELYN","There was no time to send word.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VARDIS","May I ask, My Lady, why he is with you?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CATELYN","That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VARDIS","He doesn't look like a prisoner.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CATELYN","My sister will decide what he looks like.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VARDIS","Yes, My Lady. She will at that.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"TYRION","The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"BRONN","Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes ... I'll impregnate the bitch.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"TYRION","I like you.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"STEWARD","Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","I need to see the King first -- alone.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"STEWARD","The King is at the small council meeting, My Lord. He has summoned you.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Is it about my wife?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"STEWARD","No, My Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","The whore is pregnant.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","You're speaking of m*rder a child.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both -- and that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","you will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear -- fear and blood.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Then we're no better than the Mad King.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","Careful, Ned. Careful now.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","You want to assassinate a girl ... because the Spider heard a rumor?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VARYS","No rumor, My Lord. The princess is with child.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Based on whose information?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VARYS","Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit m*rder on the word of this man?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army ...What then?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing till our enemies are on our shores? You're my council. Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"VARYS","I understand your misgivings, My Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"PYCELLE","I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","We should have had them both k*ll years ago.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","I followed you into w*r -- twice -- without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","She dies.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","I will have no part in it.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a hand who will.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. (Ned gives King Robert a slight nod, then turns and leaves.) Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a w*r!","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"JORY","Right away, My Lord. Lord Baelish (Littlefinger) is here for you.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word ""treason"" was mentioned.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","What can I do for you?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","When do you return to Winterfell?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Why? What do you care?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","I don't have the time.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LITTLEFINGER","It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"JORY","Heward and Wyl.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Find them and meet me at the stables.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LYSA","You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? (To Robin) Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? (to Catelyn) Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, ""the seed is strong."" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CATELYN","Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters -- warning me t-","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LYSA","To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ROBIN","Mommy? Is that the bad man?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LYSA","It tis.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ROBIN","He's little.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LYSA","He's Tyrion the Imp of house Lannister. He k*ll your father. He m*rder the Hand of the King!","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"TYRION","Oh? Did I k*ll him too? I've been a very busy man.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LYSA","You will watch your tongue! These men are knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved John Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"TYRION","If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ROBIN","(jumping up and shouting) You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LYSA","Shh ... Shh ... Shh, my sweet boy. (Robin sits back down on his mother's lap.) He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"ROBIN","Mommy ... I want to see the bad man fly.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LYSA","Perhaps you will, my little love.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CATELYN","This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LYSA","Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"MORD","(laughing) You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","You're jealous.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","Are you sure this won't hurt?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","Only if I slip.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","And you prefer me like this?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","hm - mmm...","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","I want you.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to w*r isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","Hold still.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","Yes well, I guess we'll never know.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","Everywhere?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about k*ll her, I swear the table rises six inches.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters -- they may be the most pompous, ponderous c**ts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","I have an outrageous amount of money.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","Not as much as the Lannisters.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","But a lot more than you.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks -- tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his k*ll. And he's the King.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","hmm ... How did that ever happen?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","Because he loves his k*ll and he used to be good at it.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","Do you know who should be King? (Both men exchange looks.)","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","Be serious.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a w*r before, but I'd fight for you.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","I'm fourth in line.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","Stannis?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","Stannis has the personality of a lobster.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","He's still my older brother.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","What are you doing?!","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","Look at it.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"RENLY","You cut me!","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"LORAS","You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love k*ll. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark -- he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","I don't know. But I do know this -- If the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea ... we won't be able to stop them.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege w*apon.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","It's a neat little trick you do -- you move your lips and your father's voice comes out.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","Is my father wrong?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles -- a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, k*ll every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King -- their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","We still outnumber them.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","Which is the bigger number -- five or one?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","Five.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","(holds both hands up in illustration) Five ... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","What do you want?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now -- back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","Our marriage.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","Every day.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","How long can hate hold a thing together?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","Well, seventeen years is quite a long time.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","Yes, it is.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","Yes, it tis. What was she like?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","So why now?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted ... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","I felt something for you once, you know?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","I know.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a ... moment?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"KING ROBERT","No. Does that make you feel better or worse?","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"CERSEI","It doesn't make me feel anything.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"MHAEGEN","She looks like him, don't she, My Lord? She has his nose, his black hair.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"
"NED","Aye.","01","05","The Wolf and The Lion"

"Robert Baratheon","You think? I think you'd remember. Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you'd f*cked one girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We used to call it ""making the eight.""","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Renly Baratheon","Those were some lucky girls.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Robert Baratheon","You ever make the eight, Barristan?","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Barristan Selmy","I don't believe so, your Grace.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Robert Baratheon","Those were the days.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Renly Baratheon","Which days, exactly? (renly stops walking and Robert turns to him) The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? (the rest of the party stop as well) Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that, when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?!","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Robert Baratheon","Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Renly Baratheon","I suppose it was all rather heroic... If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your prick inside and make the eight. (he slaps his spear to his other hand and walks off in anger. Robert looks at him. Lancel walks to Robert)","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Lancel Lannister","More wine, your Grace?","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Farmer","They burned most everything in the Riverlands (A Farmer, standing some feet away from Ned)   our fields, our granaries, (some farmers behind him look down, sullen) our homes. They took our women, then they took 'em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch, and lit them on fire (his voice croaks as he tries not to cry)","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Maester Pycelle","Brigands, most likely.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Farmer","They weren't thieves. They didn't steal nothing. (one of the farmers shakes his head) They even left something behind, your Grace.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Maester Pycelle","It's the King's Hand you're addressing, (Ned looks at him) not the King. The King is hunting.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Petyr Baelish","Fish. The Sigil of House Tully. (he leans his head towards Ned Stark and whispers) Isn't that your wife's house... Tully, my Lord Hand?","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Eddard Stark","(to the farmer) These men, were they flying a Sigil? A banner?","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Farmer","None, your... Hand. The one who was leading them... Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith in two, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Petyr Baelish","(still leaning) That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Eddard Stark","(to the farmer) You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Maester Pycelle","Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Petyr Baelish","(to Pycelle) I've heard him called Tywin Lannister's mad dog. I'm sure you have as well. (to Ned, voice lowered) Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife? (he stares at Ned, who stares back. Ned turnes back to the farmer)","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Maester Pycelle","If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the King's protection, it would be...","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Petyr Baelish","That would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.(Pycelle mumbles to himself. Petyr and Ned exchange stares. Ned turns to the farmer)","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Eddard Stark","I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life, but perhaps I can give you justice, in the name of our King, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion. (Berric steps forward from the crowd) (to Berric) You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Beric Dondarrion","As you command.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Eddard Stark","(to Berric) In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the first of his name, King of the Andals and the first men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I charge you to bring the King's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. (gasps, murmurs, and voices of outrage sound at court) I strip him of all ranks and titles, of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Maester Pycelle","(stands up, outraged) My Lord. This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Eddard Stark","Grand Maester Pycelle.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Maester Pycelle","My Lord.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Eddard Stark","Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to Court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Petyr Baelish","(to Ned, voice lowered) A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. (He stops walking) (voice raised) Gold wins wars, not soldiers.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Eddard Stark","(walking on the Throne Room floor) Then how come Robert is King and not Tywin Lannister? (walks away)","01","06","A Golden Crown"

"Lysa Arryn","(to Vadis) Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him! (she looks at Tyrion, who returns the glare. Vadis looks at Lysa, then Bronn. He lowers his helm, and they resume fighting)","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Robin Arryn","(smiling) (to Lysa) Is it over?","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Lysa Arryn","You don't fight with honor!","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Bronn","No. (He looks at the Moon Door, points, and looks back at Lysa) He did.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Robin Arryn","(to Lysa) Can I make the little man fly now?","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Tyrion Lannister","Not this little man. This little man is going home. (he stops a foot away from an elevated level overlooking him, where Rodrick is standing amongst members of the court) (looking up to Rodrick) I believe you have something of mine.","01","06","A Golden Crown"

"Sansa Stark","My mother isn't from the North.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Septa Mordane","I'm aware of that.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Sansa Stark","(looks at Mordane) Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Septa Mordane","Yes, I have hair.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Sansa Stark","I've never seen it.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Septa Mordane","Would you like to?","01","06","A Golden Crown"

"Septa Mordane","Sansa...","01","06","A Golden Crown"

"Joffrey Baratheon","You'll be Queen someday. It's only fitting you should look the part. (he looks down, then back up to Sansa) Will you forgive me for my rudeness?","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Sansa Stark","There's nothing to forgive.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Joffrey Baratheon","You're my Lady. One day we'll be married in the throne room. (Sansa smiles) Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North to the Salt Shore in the South, and you will be Queen over all of them. (Sansa smiles. Mordane, some feet away, looks down at the floor, unconvinced) I'll never disrespect you again. I'll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You're my Lady now, from this day....(he touches her cheek with his hands) until my last day.","01","06","A Golden Crown"

"Ros","I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing. Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to w*r soon. Most of them will never come back. There's nothing left for me here. (to the rider) Let's go, Stefon.","01","06","A Golden Crown"

"Arya Stark","Can we take Syrio back with us?","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Sansa Stark","Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go. I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I'm meant to be his Queen and have his babies.","01","06","A Golden Crown"

"Eddard Stark","When you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone brave, gentle and strong...","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Sansa Stark","I don't want someone brave, gentle and strong. I want him! (Arya smiles and lightly chuckles. Ned tries not to smile, looking down) He'll be the greatest King that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.","01","06","A Golden Crown"
"Arya Stark","The lion's not his sigil, idiot. (Ned keeps wondering) He's a stag, like his father.","01","06","A Golden Crown"

Daenerys pulls the maid back, and the sword shifts back to Daenerys. He lowers it down to her belly) But I can. I want what I came for. (Irri starts mutterring to Drogo, translating) I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you. Tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back.

"Sam","Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer's over, you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"

"Sam","And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","That Little Sam is your baby.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","Yes, now that's very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in. He'll get an education. He'll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","What did you tell your family about me?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","I told them I met you in the North.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","Did you tell them how far north?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","You didn't tell them where I'm really from? You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","The thing is...my father doesn't like wildlings. He hoped I'd make a man of myself by ""k*ll some bloody wildlings,"" so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","I think we're here.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Melessa","Sam. Oh, Sam.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"

"Melessa","May I hold him?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","Yes, of course.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Melessa (to little Sam)","You have a curious mind, I can tell. You'll be a scholar like your father.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","Where is Father? And Dickon?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Melessa","They're on a hunt. They'll join us for dinner. Come inside. Such a journey. You must be exhausted.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Talla","Come, you'll be wanting a bath after all that travel. Oh, and a dress for dinner. You can wear one of mine. What's your color? Midnight blue or silver? Silver, maybe. Come. You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","Is there no other way?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"High Sparrow","You're afraid for her?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","Of course I'm afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"High Sparrow","She'll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn't your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She's truly opened her heart to them.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"High Sparrow","And now she's devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Margaery","No, Your Grace.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","I've missed you. More than you could know.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Margaery","We'll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","Better how? Soon the-- walk of atonement. He says there's no other way.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Margaery","Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","Yes, a few times. Have you?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Margaery","Yes, I have. He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Margaery","You think I'm mad. I sound mad.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","No. No, you don't. You-- you could never. You're right, he's not. He's a lot more--","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Margaery","He is. There's something about him. His way of looking at the world. It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It's taken me a while. He's helped me.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","What are you talking about? You're a good person. You've always been a good person. You're the best person I know.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Margaery","Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","I don't understand.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Margaery","It's all right. It really is. It's such a relief to let go of those lies.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","What about Loras?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Margaery","I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","It's hard to walk in this.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","It's beautiful. You're beautiful.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","This venison, it's very tasty. Is it from today's hunt?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Dickon","Well, no. We haven't been able to cure that one yet. This is last week's.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Dickon","Brought it down from 70 yards. One sh*t.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","Oh, that's a fair distance.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Dickon","So do you do much hunting up at the wall?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don't hunt, you don't eat.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Dickon","Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say ""we,"" it's my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She's-- she's quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Melessa (to Gilly)","I imagine it's common where you're from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Talla","Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Randyll","That's enough of that.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Melessa","Samwell, would you care for more bread?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Randyll","Not fat enough already?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to--","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Randyll","I read your letter. You're to be a maester.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","Yes. And once I have my chain, I'll return to Castle Black.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Randyll","I thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Randyll","Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Melessa","Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","He can wield a sword. He k*ll a Thenn. He k*ll a White Walker.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Dickon","There's no such thing.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker's heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Randyll","Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he k*ll a white walker? Where are you from? How'd you come to meet my son?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","The Night's Watch came to our keep.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Randyll","Where?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","Gilly.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","North of the Wall.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Randyll","North of the Wall? You're a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged w*r against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Randyll","It's called Heartsbane. It's been in our family for 500 years. It's Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn't you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Melessa","Come, my dear. Talla.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Melessa","I've lost my appetite.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Randyll","He dishonors us.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Melessa","You dishonor yourself.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Randyll (to Sam)","Your mother's a fine woman. You're not worthy of her. To please her, I'll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The bastard will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","I'm sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","I'm not angry at you. I'm angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it. When do you have to go?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","First light.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","Say good-bye to him for me.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","You're not what he thinks you are, Sam. He doesn't know what you are.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","Good-bye, Gilly.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","Sam?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","We're leaving.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","What?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","Get your things.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","I don't have any things.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","What are you doing?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","We belong together. All of us.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","What about your mother and sister?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","Oh, they'll understand.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","Your sister's dress.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","She won't mind. Looks better on you anyway.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","Sam. That's your father's sword.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","It's my family's sword.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Gilly","Sam. Won't he come for it?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Sam","He can bloody well try.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Clarenzo","The lion and the rose are one. I thank the gods above.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Clarenzo","And to you, my beauteous bridge, I pledge undying love.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"All","Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Clarenzo","I'll drink a toast to my new queen, for there is no one fairer. Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Bobono","Drink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Bobono","The last drink he shall ever take. And vengeance shall be mine.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Clarenzo","Poison! m*rder! I gasp. I-- I die.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Clarenzo","I limp. And it was he...","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Clarenzo","...that poisoned me. My evil Uncle Imp.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","My firstborn son. My golden lion foully, falsely slain. I pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","Hear my prayer, O cruel gods. Take my life instead. For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead. Oh, woe. Oh grief.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow. All hope is lost. All joy is gone. And there is no tomorrow.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Bobono","What is that I hear and smell? Someone I'll soon send to hell.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Bobono","It's time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Izembaro","You beast. You beast. You k*ll my wife and now you've taken your father's life.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Izembaro (O.C.)","No worse child ever stained this land.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Izembaro","Curse the day I named you.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Bobono","My greatest crime. Now I must flee.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Bobono (O.C.)","Then sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Bobono (O.C.)","Don't fear the winter.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Bobono","Fear me!","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Izembaro (O.C.)","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca, Clarenzo.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Izembaro","I give you Bobono.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Izembaro","I give you Camello.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Izembaro (O.C.)","And last but not least, sweet Lady Crane.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Camello","Give this a good b*at. Shake those fleas out. That's a dear.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Izembaro (to Bianca)","That crowd was shit.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","Girl.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","What are you doing back here?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Arya","Nothing.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","I saw you the other day in the audience. How many times have you seen this stupid play?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Arya","Three times.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","Did you pay?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Arya","No.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","I remember when the players came to my village. I didn't have any money, so I snuck in. Just like you. Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms. I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Arya","You're very good.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","My final speech is shit.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing's no good.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Arya","So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","How would you change it?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Arya","The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn't just cry. She would be angry. She would want to k*ll the person who did this to her.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","What's your name?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Arya","Mercy.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","Wonderful eyebrows. Do you like pretending to be other people?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Arya","I have to go. My father's waiting for me.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Bianca","Lady Crane, they loved you.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","They were sweet. Or drunk. Drunkenly sweet.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Izembaro","No laugh for Ned's death. These people are worse than animals.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Izembaro","But they loved her. They all love her.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Camello","Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","I do what I can with what I'm given.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Izembaro","With what you're given?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","Well, I was thinking--","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Izembaro","Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Izembaro","Full to the tits with ideas.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lady Crane","I didn't mean--","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Izembaro","You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas. Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I've been doing this my whole life? Who is anyone to judge my work? This is my profession. I know what I'm doing.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Izembaro","You have no right to an opinion.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Arya","Careful of that one. She wants you dead.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Jaqen","And?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Waif","As I expected.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Jaqen","A shame. A girl had many gifts.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Waif","You promised me.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Jaqen","Don't let her suffer.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Mace","My lord.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Jaime","My lord.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Mace","My friends, the hour has come. Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children. But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came. Madness has had its day!","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Captain","Forward, march!","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"High Sparrow","Rich or poor, noble or common, if we win, we must atone. Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner. She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied. She turned a blind eye to her brother's sins. She disgraces her house, the king, and herself.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Captain","Company, halt! Face front! Turn!","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"High Sparrow","Lord Tyrell.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"High Sparrow","Ser Jaime.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Jaime","Sorry to interrupt. We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we'll be on our way.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"High Sparrow","I don't have the authority to give them to you. And you don't have the authority to take them.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Captain","Lock spears!","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Jaime","I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"High Sparrow","The gods don't recognize his authority in this matter.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Jaime","You already insulted one great house. It won't happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"High Sparrow","To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Captain","Order up!","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"High Sparrow","Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"High Sparrow","Together we announce a new age of harmony. A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Woman","Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","The crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests. Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Mace (to Olenna)","What's happening?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Olenna","He's b*at us. That's what's happening.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown. Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Jaime","I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","I have to answer to the gods.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Jaime","Not when you're sitting in that chair.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","The Crown's decision on this matter is final.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Jaime","Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Tommen","You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years. And you will continue to do so. But not in this city.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Walder","You've lost it?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Black Walder","Yes, father.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Walder","It's a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didn't lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lothar","He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Walder","You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and k*ll him, you couldn't find him. That's what it means to lose something. Now he's come back and taken Riverrun.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Black Walder","I don't think it's fair to blame us--","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Walder","For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Black Walder","We don't have the men.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Walder","We've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Black Walder","The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lothar","The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Black Walder","Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Walder","If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge. They're laughing at us. All across the Riverlands right down to King's Landing, they're laughing at us.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Walder","I hear it in my sleep! I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you. And I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter. Take that castle back.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Lothar","He'll never yield, Father.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Walder","Oh, he'll yield.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Walder","You'll show him the kn*fe you used to k*ll Robb Stark's child in his whore mother's belly, and you'll show him the kn*fe you used to open his niece's throat. And you'll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place. His nephew.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Walder","Cheer up, Lord Edmure. You're going home.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Jaime","I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own because he's 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Cersei","BEtter you're elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Jaime","I'm not going to the Riverlands.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Cersei","What, then?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Jaime","I'm going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen and have him gather the best k*ll he knows. I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head and every other sparrow head I can find.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Cersei","You can't.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Jaime","He has our son! He stole our son! He's torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Cersei","We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you k*ll the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Jaime","You'll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Cersei","It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They've made us both stronger, all of them.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Cersei","They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we're going to do to them.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Cersei","We've always been together. We'll always be together. We're the only two people in the world.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Meera","Why did you help us?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Rider","The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Meera","The Three-Eyed Raven's dead.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Rider","Now he lives again.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Rider (to Bran)","When I last saw you, you were a boy. A fearless boy. Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Bran","Who are you?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Bran","Uncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Benjen","I led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers. They found us. A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice. Left me there to die. To turn. The Children found me. Stopped the walker's magic from taking hold.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Bran","How?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Benjen","The same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Bran","Dragonglass. A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Benjen","You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Bran","I didn't have time to learn. I can't control anything.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Benjen","You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Benjen","Drink.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Benjen","One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men. When he does, you will be there waiting for him. And you will be ready.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daario","Everything all right?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daenerys","How many days' ride to Meereen?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daario","A week at best.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daenerys","How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daario","Dothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons-- 1,000 ships easily. Probably more.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daenerys","And who has that many?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daario","Nobody.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daenerys","Nobody yet.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daario","So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daenerys","I take what is mine.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daario","You weren't made to sit on a chair in a palance.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daenerys","What was I made for?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daario","You're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daenerys","Wait here.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daario (speaking Dothraki)","I'm going after her. Wait for me here.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daenerys (speaking Dothraki)","Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daenerys (speaking Dothraki)","I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daenerys","Will you k*ll my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daenerys","Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daenerys","Are you with me?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"
"Daenerys","Now and always?","06","06","Blood of My Blood"

"Ray","And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving. Come on, come on.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Ray","In all my days I've never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sandor","Just one.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Ray","Ooh. he must have been some kind of monster.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sandor","He was a woman.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Ray","I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sandor","I'm used to it.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Ray","When I found you, I thought you'd been dead for days. The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Ray","I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh, nearly shit myself. I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn't. Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn't. What kept you going?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sandor","Hate.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Ray","No, there's a reason you're still here.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sandor","Aye, there's a reason. I'm a big f*ck and I'm tough to k*ll.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Ray","No, a reason. Gods aren't done with you yet.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sandor","I've heard that before. Man was talking about a different god, though.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Ray","Well, maybe he was right. I don't know much about the gods.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sandor","You're in the wrong line of work.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Ray","Oh, there's plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods. I don't. I don't even know their real names. Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it's the old gods. Or maybe it's the Lord of Light. Or maybe they're all the same f*cking thing. I don't know. What matters, I believe, is that there's something greater than us. And whatever it is, it's got plans for Sandor Clegane.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sandor","You didn't know me back in my time. You don't know the things I've done.","06","07","The Broken Man"

"High Sparrow","Ah, ""As water rounds the stones, smoothing--""","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","""Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman's love calm a man's brute nature. A wife salves her husband's wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep.""","06","07","The Broken Man"
"High Sparrow","You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don't have a drop of the Mother's mercy in their blood and savages who can't read at all who understand the Father's wisdom.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"High Sparrow","They are hard to love.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"High Sparrow","The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions. They show us what we'd look like without our fine clothes. How'd we smell without perfume.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"High Sparrow","Can I ask you about a personal matter?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","Of course.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"High Sparrow","The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven't joined him in the marriage bed.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","No.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"High Sparrow","You have a duty, Your Grace. To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","It's just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"High Sparrow","Congress does not require desire on the woman's part, only patience. The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","Forgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"High Sparrow","Hard to find and harder still to walk upon. But you've made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","My grandmother?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"High Sparrow","Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","Oh, this is madness!","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna (to Septa Unella)","You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about...","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","Grandmother.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","...until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","Grandmother, please.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","What have they done to you?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","We marched for you.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn't. They showed mercy.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","Loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He'll have to renounce his name and title...","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","Have you lost your mind?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","...and live his life as a penitent.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","He can begin again.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","As a mindless fanatic.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","As a free man.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","But you should leave, Grandmother. Your place is at home.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","I will never leave you. Never.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","You must.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","Go home. Find comfort in prayer and good works.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","The Mother watches over us all.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","I'll see you soon, my dear.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Margaery","Shall we pray?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Dim Dalba","We said we'd fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn't what we agreed to. These aren't White Walkers. This isn't an army of the dead. This isn't our find.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Tormund","If it weren't for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King's army. And I'd be a pile of charred bones just like Mance.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Dim Dalba","Remember Mance's camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what's left of us. And if we lose this, we're gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We'll be the last of the free folk.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna b*at them, and we need to b*at them if you're going to survive.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Tormund","The crows k*ll him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we're cowards. And if that's what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Wun Wun","Snow.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow (to Tormund)","Are you sure they'll come?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Tormund","We're not clever like you southerners. When we say we'll do something, we do it.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Cersei","I heard you were leaving King's Landing.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","That is hardly your concern.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Cersei","Your grandson is still a prisoner. You'll leave him rotting in a cell?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Cersei","You're right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","Good.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Cersei","I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met. At a certain age, it's hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I'll never forget it.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Cersei","You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It's the only truth I know. We must defend them.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you're half as bright as you think you are, you'll find your way out of here, too.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Cersei","Never. I'll never leave my son.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Olenna","What'll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You're going to k*ll them all by yourself? You've lost, Cersei. It's the only joy I can find in all this misery.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Man","Pick the pace up. Keep going.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Man #2","Keep it moving!","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Bronn","Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","Someone certainly does.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Bronn","Oh, no. Not me. I'm just an upjumped sellsword.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Bronn","Aye, knights don't get paid.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Bronn","That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Bronn","You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","And you'll get all three. A Lannister always--","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Bronn","Don't say it. Don't f*cking say it.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lothar","Come out and fight us, Blackfish. Yield the castle or we'll hang him.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lothar","This is your last warning. Yield the castle.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Black Walder","You think I won't do it, old man?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Black Walder","I sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a f*cking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Brynden","Go on, then. Cut his throat.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","Lothar, is it?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lothar","Ser Jaime. We didn't know you were coming.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","‘Cause you didn't set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Bronn","Good thing we're friends or we'd be f*cking you in the ass right now.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Black Walder","Whoa, whoa.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lothar","Walder.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Black Walder","Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out. Now let's say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I'd do?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Black Walder","I don't give a rat's--","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you'd like to take his place.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lothar","Apologies, Ser Jaime.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lothar","Do as he says.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Bronn","Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Black Walder","Those are our siege towers--","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","As I said, the siege is under my command. If that's not to your liking, go home.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Bronn","A parley or a fight?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","He's an old man.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Bronn","You've got one hand. My money's on the old boy.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","Lady Mormont.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lyanna","Welcome to Bear Island.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sansa","I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I'm sure you will be, too.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lyanna","I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact--","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lyanna","I think we've had enough small talk. What are you here?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was k*ll. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said--","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lyanna","I remember what it said. ""Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.""","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lyanna","As far as I understand, you're a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I've heard conflicting reports.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sansa","I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lyanna","If you say so. In any case, you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that--","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lyanna","I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's w*r?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Davos","If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lyanna","I don't know you, Ser...?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Davos","Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Davos","You needn't ask your maester about my house. It's rather new.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lyanna","All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Davos","You never thought you'd find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I'd be in my position. I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of w*r. But I'm here because this isn't someone else's w*r. It's our w*r.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lyanna","Go on, Ser Davos.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Davos","Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real w*r isn't between a few squabbling houses. It's between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lyanna","Is this true?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Davos","As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there's no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lyanna","House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lyanna","62.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","62?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Lyanna","We are not a large house, but we're a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Davos","If they're half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Brynden","Kingslayer.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","Blackfish.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Brynden","I assume you're here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don't see Sansa and Arya.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","I don't have them.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Brynden","Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Brynden","Then why are you here?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","You know why I'm here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You're trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or--","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Brynden","Or you'll k*ll Edmure?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Brynden","My nephew's marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","It won't stop with Edmure. You'll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Brynden","Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","We'll breach them and k*ll every last one of you. But if you surrender, I'll spare the lives of your men. On my honor.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Brynden","Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","The w*r is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Brynden","As long as I'm standing, the w*r is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives. Why did you come to treat with me?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Brynden","Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jaime","Well, now you have.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Brynden","Aye, now I have. I'm disappointed.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Robett","The answer is no.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Robett","I've heard enough. We've only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton--","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Robett","Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","House Mormont.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Robett","And?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","We sent raven to Houses Manderly--","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Robett","I don't care about ravens. You're asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Robett","Then the rumors are true. I didn't dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","Lord Glover.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Robett","There's nothing else to say.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sansa","I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Robett","Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father's death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb's call and hailed him King in the North.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Robett","And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and k*ll our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him k*ll.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Robett","I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Theon","Why did we have to come here?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Theon","I don't want one.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","Don't go far, love.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","I'll find you in a bit.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn't interest you anymore?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","I'm sorry. I won't joke about it. I'll never hurt you, little brother. Don't you know that?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Theon","You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","Of course he is. As long as we're alive, we're a threat.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Theon","He'll find us.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","It's a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Theon","I don't want any.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","I don't care what you want. Drink.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","Drink it all.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","You're Ironborn, Theon. I know you've had some bad years.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Theon","Some bad years?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","But I'm tired of watching you cower like a b*at dog. Drink the g*dd*mn ale.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you're never going back. We'll get justice for you.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Theon","If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","f*ck justice, then. We'll get revenge. Drink.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","Listen to me. If you're so broken that there's no coming back, take a kn*fe and cut your wrists. End it. But if you're staying, Theon, I need you. We're gonna sail to Meereen. We're gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen. And we're gonna take back the Iron Islands.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","Are you with me? Are you really with me?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Yara","Now, since it's my last night ashore for a long while, I'm gonna go f*ck the tits off this one.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Davos","Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sansa","And that's a good thing?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Davos","He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There's a stream down there for the horses.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","We're not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Davos","Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Davos","2,000 Wildlings. 200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins--","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sansa","62 Mormonts.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Davos","It's not what we'd hoped for. But we still have a chance if we're careful and smart.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Davos","For f*ck's sake.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sansa","So he's your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sansa","Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who m*rder his own brother, who doesn't have a head?","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sansa","It's not enough. We need more men.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","There's no time.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Sansa","If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord--","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Jon Snow","We fight with the army we have.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Davos","Friends, this is not worth fighting over!","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Davos","This'll be it, now. Right now, we don't need to be fighting.","06","07","The Broken Man"
"Man","Who the f*ck are you?","06","07","The Broken Man"

I'm your m*rder. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren't animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours.
